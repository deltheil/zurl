zurl - URL transfer w/ on-the-fly client-side compression

Sample code that illustrates how to combine libcurl with client-side, on-the-fly
zlib compression[1].

It could be handy to save space on the client if server-side HTTP compression
is not available.

Otherwise it's simpler to accept encoding (`Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`)
while taking care to turn off decoding[2] on libcurl side.
